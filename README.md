# Project Overview

## Core Functionality:
- QR Code Generation: Users can enter a URL or some text, and the application generates a QR code that, when scanned, directs to the specified URL or displays the text.
- Custom Backgrounds Using AI: Alongside the QR code, users can input a prompt describing a scene or concept (e.g., "a ledge overlooking Mount Everest"). The application then communicates with an AI-powered service (such as Gooey AI) to generate an image based on this prompt, which is used as the QR code's background.

## Key Components:
- HeroSection: The main component where users interact with the application. It includes input fields for the URL/text and the background prompt, a button to initiate the generation process, and displays the resulting QR code with its custom background.
- Header: A component that contains navigation and branding information.
- Custom 404 Page: Enhances user experience by providing a friendly error message and navigation options when a user visits a non-existent route.

## Technologies and Libraries:
- Next.js: The core framework providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and efficient handling of assets and API routes.
- React: Used for building the user interface, managing component state, and handling user interactions.

## External APIs:
- QR Code Generation API: An service that generates QR codes based on provided data.
- Gooey AI API: For generating background images based on text prompts. The integration is done via server-side requests to keep the API key secure.
- Environment Variables: Utilized for securely storing API keys and other sensitive information, with a focus on not exposing them to the client-side unless necessary (and prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side access).
- Custom Styling: The snippets indicate the use of Tailwind CSS for styling components, evidenced by utility class names like flex, justify-center, and bg-[#27272a].

## Security and Best Practices:
- The project demonstrates an awareness of security best practices by handling API keys in a manner that prevents them from being exposed to the client-side, likely through server-side API routes or serverless functions.
- Custom error handling (such as the 404 page) enhances the user experience by guiding users back to the application's functional parts when they stray.

## Development Practices:
- Use of modern JavaScript features and React hooks (useState, useEffect, and useRef) for managing component lifecycle, state, and references.
- The application structure suggests a modular approach, with separate components for different parts of the UI, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

> This project illustrates a creative use of AI and QR code technology to offer a unique service, blending practical utility with the novelty of AI-generated art.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
